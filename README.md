# Mask Detection Classifier with deployment feature

This project allows users to classify images using a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) directly in their browser. With just one line of code, you can deploy and test this mask detection app effortlessly.

## Features
- **Browser-Based:** The app runs directly in your browser—no additional setup required.
- **Simple to Use:** Just upload a photo, and the app will quickly determine if a face is wearing a mask or not.
- **Customizable:** Leverage the pretrained model to classify your own content.

## Installation
To get started:
1. Ensure you have the latest stable version of Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Model Training
The pretrained model was trained on Kaggle resources and offers excellent accuracy. For those interested, you can retrain or modify the model by following this [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nikitaglazunov/face-mask-classification-task-with-best-accuracy). It’s fast and easy to use!

## Usage
1. Run the app with the following command:
   ```bash
   python app.py
2. Open the link displayed in your Python console (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
3. Upload any photo to the app interface.
4. View the classification result in seconds!
